There's not much to see here yet, I'm building a database from scratch in Rust to learn more about database systems.

So far this implementation solely relies on a simple Write-Ahead Log that can be compacted from time to time. I'm open to suggestions on features or the general design of the implementation (or anything, really).

In the end I'd like this to be a functional (but not production-ready) document database (a far simpler MongoDB or similar).

Anyway, feel free to look at this, don't expect much though.
